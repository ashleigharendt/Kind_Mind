<h1>Why Kind Mind</h1>

<p1> Helping other people is good for your mind</<p1>

<p1> You might feel too busy to help other people, but research suggests random acts of kindness reduce stress and improves your mood.</p1>

<h2> That warm and fuzzy feeling</h2>
<p1> Acts of kindness creates a wave of chemicals which improve mood and reduce anxiety. Oxytocin, is the hormone released, which encourages the body to relax and feel at ease with others. It is fondly known as 'the cuddle hormone'!

<h2>Sense of belonging</h2>
<p1> We live in times where it's easy to feel isolated and like the world is full of 'bad people'. This is because the media points out all of the bad things that are going on in the world. Giving and receiveing random actos of kindness functions to reset the balance. Making us all feel part of a community and that humans really are good people</p1>

<h2> Puts things into perspective</h2>
<p1> It's hard to stop overthinking about what might happen if you don't live up to your own wicked standards around work/love/study/friendships. Helping other people takes you outside of the worrisome context of all the 'what if's'. Helping people less fortunate than yourself makes you grateful for what you have already, and more certain that if you were in real trouble someone would be around to help you out.</p1>


<h2>Kindness can help us live longer</h2>
<p1> That's right, giving out kindness, can increase life span. Studies of the elderly show that those who give support live longer than those who don't. Positive emotions boost our immune system, and oxytocin, the hormone released after completing a random act of kindness has protective properties for the heart.</p1>
