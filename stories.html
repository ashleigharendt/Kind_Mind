<h1>STORIES <br> Real Random Acts of Kindness from our friends </h1>

<h2> Adam, 25 (Oxford)</h2>

<p> Jason (homeless) said he'd like something hot, so I got a meal deal from the fried chicken shop. He really appreciated it, and I got to learn a bit about him as we shared the chips. </p>

<h2> Nathen , 24</h2>

<p> We were parked up in our van in a parking lot up a mountain near San Sebastián, Spain. It was -3 degrees and snowing and we were nice a snug in the van. Even so, a couple came a knocked on the window. We opened it expecting them to tell us to move on. They asked if we lived in the van and when we said yes they told us where there house was and if we needed anything or even just wanted to come for a cup of tea we were more than welcome</p>

<h2>Quadeer, as told by Sumra</h2>

<p>After Qadeer’s interview at an assessment centre a few years ago in Manchester, he  was pretty exhausted and ran out the centre and jumped into a waiting car by the taxi rank. He gave his destination “Manchester train station” and sat back to unwind whilst making small talk with the cab driver. At the end, Qadeer went to pay for the journey when the driver turned around and said “I’m not a taxi mate!” Lol! He had just given Qadeer a lift for free as he thought he probably needed it after the stress of the assessment centre! 

</p>

<h2> Rowena and Cassy</h2>

<p>Cassy, do you remember when we were running down Ryde pier because we were about to miss the IOW ferry and a taxi driver drove us the really short journey (without charging us) so we didn't miss it?</p>

<h2> Laila</h2>

<p> 
I dropped my credit card near home a few weeks ago on my way to meet a friend for a coffee. When u couldn't find it at the coffee shop I cancelled it. The next day I got a call from Peter Jones to say some one had found my card, seen it was a John Lewis card and gone in to hand it in. Very thoughtful that someone would take the time and trouble to do that :) </p>
