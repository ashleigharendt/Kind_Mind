<h2>A random act of kindness generator</h2>

<p>1. Call a friend<p>
<p>Call an old pal you haven't spoken to for a while. Think about something you're grateful to them for. Maybe they picked you up in the rain once? Maybe they got you coffee once? Bring it up and hear the surprise in their voice</p>

<p>2. Pass on a beloved book</p>
<p>Leave a book on a bench to pass on to a stranger. Maybe you could include a note to encourage them to pass it on again?</p>

<p>3. Share dinner with your friend or flatmate</p>
<p>Next time you make food, why not share it with your flatmate, and use the opportunity to spark up some conversation</p>
