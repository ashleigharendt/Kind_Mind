		<p>1. Call a friend<p>
		<p>Call an old pal you haven't spoken to for a while. Think about something you're grateful to them for. Maybe they picked you up in the rain once? Maybe they got you coffee once? Bring it up and hear the surprise in their voice</p>

		<p>2. Pass on a beloved book</p>
		<p>Leave a book on a bench to pass on to a stranger. Maybe you could include a note to encourage them to pass it on again?</p>

		<p>3. Share dinner with your friend or flatmate</p>
		<p>Next time you make food, why not share it with your flatmate, and use the opportunity to spark up some conversation</p>

		<p>4. Stamps</p>
		<p>Save up used stamps (from the UK and abroad) and charities can earn money from them, see here https://www.rnib.org.uk/donations-and-fundraising/fundraising-your-community/stamps-appeal</p>

		<p>6.Leave a positive post-it on someone's desk</p>
		<p>Write your study buddy or colleague a word of encouragement and leave it for them</p>

		<p>7.Put extra change in the parking meter/loo turnstile for the next person</p>
		<p>Add some extra silvers after you've paid for your parking. Or in one of the UK train terminal loos, you could leave extra change in the turnstile after you've done your business; spend a penny in a different way and you might make somebody's day :) </p>

		<p>8.Let someone in front of the queue</p>
		<p>We're always in such a rush, why not let someone in front of you at the queue at the coffee shop or supermarket? Then you can kick back and relax in that warm fuzzy feeling. </p>

		<p>9. Buy a meal for a homeless person</p>
		<p> If you're a bit strapped for cash yourself, make use of the reductions supermarket's have at the end of the day to buy a meal for a homeless person. Alternatively, you could share a buy one get one free with a homeless person. </p>

		<p>10. Strike up a conversation with the next elderly person you meet</p>
		<p> It's a lonely world at the best of times, and those in the older generation often struggle. Why not take it further than hello the next time you're next to an old lady or gentleman on the bus, or in the queue for the supermarket. </p>

		<p>11. Pay someone a compliment</p>
		<p> Kind words are free, and they make such a difference to a person's day. Make somebody smile by paying them a compliment today, extra points if it's someone you find it difficult to get along with. </p>

		<p>12. Smile</p>
		<p> Smile, and the world smiles with you; so spread that grin far and wide. Bring it to the places that need it the most, the London Underground at rush hour needs your cheeky smile.</p>

		<p>13. Make someone a playlist</p>
		<p> Make someone close a playlist of tunes that remind you of them, for them to listen to when they feel sad or alone. Don't underestimate the power of music to brighten up someone's mood.</p>

		<p>14. Write someone a letter</p>
		<p> People love receiving letters, it's such a treat for something which isn't a bill to land on the doormat. Write a friend a heartfelt or silly letter, they'll appreciate it.</p>

		<p>15. If you see someone sleeping rough, help connect them to local homelessness services</p>
		<p> Streetlink is a charity which can provide support to homeless people, but which relies on the public to notify them to those who are sleeping rough. Download the Streetlink app, or use the link here: http://www.streetlink.org.uk/ </p>
